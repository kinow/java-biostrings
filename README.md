#Java Biostrings

A Java port of the [R Biostrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html)
library.

This project was created to practice the [Apache Commons Text](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/)
code capabilities.

Licensed under the MIT license, not released to Apache Maven Central as this is more of an experiment
for Commons Text right now.
